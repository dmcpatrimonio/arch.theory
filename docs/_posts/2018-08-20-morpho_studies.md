The concept of a building type is first articulated in the early
nineteenth-century writings of French theoretician Quatremère de Quincy
(1755--1849). The definition of type is closely associated with
imitation as a guiding principle of classicism and, conversely, opposed
to the notion of exemplar model. It consists in tracing back to an
"original principle" drawn from "the nature of each region, historical
notions, and the monuments themselves found in mature art."[^1] Type is
in turn reported to the expression of character, to which there are
three levels: *essential* character pertains to how a work of
architecture respects the universal laws of nature embodied in the
principle of construction; *incidental* character has to do with the
particulars of each building culture, as it develops with respect to
climate, geography, and society; the lowest degree of determinacy is
attached to *relative* character, which represents the analogy between
appearance and purpose.[^2]

The Modernist worldview turns this hierarchy on its end. It does so at
first by declaring that "form follows function," therefore raising
relative character from last to first determinant in the design process,
and then by asserting that "left and right, front and back, and possibly
even above and below" are "equal in value,"[^3] thereby obviating any
observance of essential character. Finally, the adequacy of building
types to the place and culture they belong to---that is, incidental
character---is superseded both by the increasingly wide availability of
standardized, industrial building elements, and, at the opposite end, by
the glorification of the individual architect's uniqueness.

The impact of this reversal in architectural theory and scholarship is
so strong that they become mostly unable to acknowledge the role of
place, history, and culture in shaping the built environment. The German
geographer, M.R.G. Conzen (1907--2000), working from the disciplinary
perspective of landscape studies, sets the foundations for the
present-day field of urban morphology, in which typology plays an
important part. Nevertheless, primacy is given to the plan and,
especially, to the parcel patterns, which are assumed to preexist and
determine building types.[^4]
