The struggle for rigour in architectural scholarship in post-war Italy
resulted in an engaging and diverse body of argumentative and exemplary
writings by well-known authors such as Saverio Muratori (1910--1973),
Aldo Rossi (1931--1997), and Manfredo Tafuri (1935--1994). Their often
conflicting positions on the craft of architectural history, its
relationship to design practice, and the establishment of disciplinary
parameters for either history or design, set the foundational arguments
for much of the international debate around these themes.

The validity of extracting 'operative' knowledge from history for use in
architectural and urban practice is one among many debates in which
these architects engaged.[^1] This controversy is expressed most clearly
in their differing attitudes towards typology as either an art
historical device or a theory of the architectural planning process.

The Italian universe of typological studies is probably best known
through Aldo Rossi's idiosyncratic definition of the concept, in *The
Architecture of the City,* as the study of 'constants' underlying urban
and architectural 'facts' and discernible in them.[^2] Saverio
Muratori's contribution, on the other hand, is restricted to the
technical domain of urban morphology,[^3] to a great extent due to his
ostracism from the mainstream critical panorama, brought about by his
ideological condemnation at the hands of Bruno Zevi and Manfredo
Tafuri.[^4] Tafuri himself towers tall as one of the most acclaimed
architectural historians of the post--1968 era, not the least for his
combative---though at times inconsistent---argument for the critical
autonomy of architectural history outside the professional scope of the
architectural discipline.[^5]

Nowadays, however, and especially outside Italy, the critical
perspectives around these three architects are mostly cut off from one
another, being concerned with specific subfields in research and
practice, the scopes of which have been increasingly delimited to
reflect their respective methodological and ideological *partis pris.*
This segmentation of theories and scholarship influenced by Muratori,
Rossi, and Tafuri is not only a misrepresentation of their frequent
engagement with one another's theories;[^6] it also obscures the claim
put forward by each one of them to a systematic representation of and
agency on the urban environment.

The confrontation of Tafuri's critical underpinnings for an autonomous
and critical history of architecture[^7] with Muratori's and Rossi's
methods for the operative appropriation of historical research in design
exposes the overarching conflicts in world view among them, of course,
but beneath these differences certain fundamental affinities show
through, evidencing how they partake in the major intellectual and
political themes of their age. These affinities have not, however, been
carried on by their disciples and interpreters as clearly as their
differences. This has caused Muratori's, Rossi's, and Tafuri's work to
become somewhat abstract and disconnected from the role they all
expected their critique to play in the transformation of urban
planning.[^8] In other words, what they have in common is they intended
not so much to propose a general theory of architectural form---for
Muratori was sceptical of formal rules, Rossi was sceptical of
generalisations, and Tafuri was sceptical of theorising---, but rather
to look at the contemporary city as a *process* to be acted upon
politically and technically.[^9]

In light of their common goal of contributing critically to processes
rather than objects, one can begin to draw a clearer picture of their
affinities and conflicts, putting the acrid debates of the 1960s and 70s
in the long-term perspective of how their legacies have been, and could
be, carried on throughout the evolving ideological configurations of the
architectural profession. To this end, the study of the direct 'lineage'
of the second and third generation of Muratori's disciples,[^10] as well
as of other practitioners and scholars influenced by Rossi's poetics of
the city and by Tafuri's critical historiography, offers an overview of
what rigorous architectural scholarship can look like in the present
day. This loosely defined group of architects may be, for starters,
grouped in an 'Italian school of typology' of sorts.

This 'school' shall be defined, initially, by the shared scope of
objects and methods pertaining to the architectural discipline, reaching
back to the superimposition of idealist philosophy and socialist
politics that was pervasive in post-war Italian architectural
circles.[^11] This disciplinary framing understands architecture to be
not a specific set of objects, real or potential, but a process of
bringing about change in the urban fabric; conversely, history is not
envisaged as a coherent narrative to be 'found', but as a collection of
fragments of which to make sense in a piecemeal fashion.[^12]

On top of this common ground, providing a shared understanding of the
profession's role in the contemporary world, a second level of analysis
reveals an implicit awareness of the conflicts between historiographical
critique, ever bent on scattering and reassembling the fragments in
infinite ways,[^13] and operative synthesis, demanding agreement, if
limited and provisional, on reconstructed 'memories' of the urban
process to be acted upon critically.[^14]

The cracks developing from these conflicts become rifts, on a third
level, between the 'modernist' disciples of Muratori[^15]---among them
Gianfranco Caniggia, Gian Luigi Maffei, Giancarlo Cataldi, and Giuseppe
Strappa---and the 'traditionalists'[^16] or 'new
classicists'[^17]---such as Pier Carlo Bontempi, Gabriele Tagliaventi,
and Cristiano Rosponi---loosely inspired by the figurative character of
Rossi's later work. This cleaving of the 'Italian school' hinges on the
decomposition of the urban 'organism', in the work of living
practitioners, according to diverging hierarchies of abstract and
figurative elements.[^18] This conflict exposes conceptual weaknesses in
the theories supporting typological design, in terms of the choices
practitioners make when appropriating and making sense of urban
fragments.

Thus, the analysis turns back for a final look at how critical
historiography addresses the shortcomings of operativity. By looking at
the interaction of historical scholarship and design practice in the
work of architects who combine both activities,[^19] the theoretical
assumptions linking both fields become clear. The typological
contradictions between the 'historic city' strictly
defined---preindustrial urbanism[^20]---and the urban fabric of the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries appears as an unresolved
conflict in the methods and judgements of 'modernists' from the
Muratorian school[^21] and of traditionalists alike.[^22]
