Base building in the Alentejo region of Portugal
================================================

The base urban type in early modern Alentejo building culture
stems from the replacement of ancient Roman and Arabic
patio houses with the rural unit of single-cell houses
extended by agglutination
[@costa:2015mertola, p. 94] (Figure 2).
The *morada de duas casas* (two-house dwelling)
thus formed is also known as *habitação de frente estreita*
(narrow-frontage housing).
It is composed, minimally, of
one *casa de fora* (outer house) and
one *casa de dentro* (inner house) or
*câmara* (chamber).
Each of these is a single square-ish room,
placed in longitudinal succession,
with aligned openings that double as
doors and windows.
In the town of Mértola, which contains canonical expressions
of this building type, Miguel Reimão Costa points out:

> The position of the lower hearth, where fire was built,
> was very inconsistent, since it might just as well
> appear in the *casa de fora* or in the *casa de dentro,*
> or even take place in a third *casa,* separate from
> the other two, designated as the *casa do fogo*
> [house of the fire(place)].

This base type---minimal in its concept as well as
in its size---is enlarged by accretion of identical units.
In time, hallways, stairways, and yards are introduced
to articulate this accretion into ever larger houses.
The development of the parcel system runs parallel
to the articulation of this type,
moving from shallow lots to deeper ones
that support the longitudinal duplication of the type.

The *habitação de frente estreita*
is subsequently developed into
the *morada de casas altas* (tall-house dwelling)
as well as into the *habitação de frente larga*
(broad-frontage housing).
When both developments---horizontal and vertical---are
concurrent, the resulting type is known as
*sobrado* (two-story house).
Horizontal accretion may be literal, brought about by
the purchase and incorporation of adjoining buildings,
when the town fabric is old enough to display
such accommodations.
In more recent towns, however, it is a conceptual operation
by means of which a house is designed as an ensemble
of cell units organized with or without circulation spaces.
