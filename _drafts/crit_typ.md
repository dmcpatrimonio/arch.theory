Typology *versus* historiography
================================

For all that has been said about the modernist
rejection of history, the Bauhaus
did comparatively little to push practitioners
and historians apart from each other.
Rather, this rift opened as the methodologies
of historiographical narrative and
historically informed design were being tailored
to achieve opposite goals.

The difference between Rossi's and Muratori's concepts
of typology is illustrative of the ever widening rift
between architectural historians and
practitioners---even though both architects moved
from design to historiography and back
throughout their careers.
The emergence of architectural history is attested
in the groundbreaking work and exemplary careers
of three scholars who were also practising architects,
who set the initial standards for two quite
distinct approaches to the discipline:
first, as a chair within the École des Beaux-Arts
under Viollet-le-Duc (1815--1879),
then as a specialized branch of art history
in the work of the German writers,
Heinrich von Geymüller (1839--1909) and
Cornelius Gurlitt (1850--1938).

Viollet-le-Duc's teaching gave greater rigor to
the conventional use of historical sources
as a basis for design, whereas
the German approach was chiefly concerned with
evidencing a systematic history of styles
in the idealist tradition.
The popularity of Heinrich Wölfflin's (1864--1945)
schematic narratives and Pevsner's influential books
are part of the eventual success of
the German branch of purely academic
architectural history.
