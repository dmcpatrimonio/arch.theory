Claiming disciplinary boundaries for typology
=============================================

Typology is generally understood to be the processes
or operations by which a "concept of a house"---or of
any sort of more or less specialized building---is
generated, transformed, and eventually studied.
[@caniggia:1997metodologia, p. 15]
What is to be done with this study is, on the other hand,
far less generally agreed upon.
The Spanish architect, Rafael Moneo famously argued for
"the 'impossibility' of continuity, and thus of
the retrieval of type in its most traditional and
characteristic sense. . . ." [@moneo:1978typology, p. 38]
Moneo expressed a modernist worldview
that assumes an insurmountable break between
past and present and an irrevocable loss of innocence,
of sorts, that comes with the intellectual articulation
of concepts:

> Did not the historical awareness of the *fact* of type
> in architectural theory forever bar the unity of its
> practice? Or, to put it in another way, is not the
> theoretical recognition of a fact the symptom of its
> loss? [@moneo:1978typology, p. 40]

The rationale for this argument hinged on the ambiguous
role of J.-N.L. Durand's design method codified in the
*Recueil et parallèle* and
*Précis des leçons données à l'École polytechnique*.
The latter's core teaching, in particular, titled
"De la marche que l'on doit suivre dans la composition
d'un projet quelconque," [@durand:1805precis2, p. 96]
poisoned Moneo's---and other modernists'---understanding
of explicit typological operations.
These operations are then considered formalist exercises
devoid of functional or social meaning.
They are, therefore, to be dismissed as
mere "reproduction," in Durand's method, or worse,
morally condemned as "nostalgia," [@moneo:1978typology, p. 38]
the mortal sin of postmodernity.

More serious students of typology have not been deterred
by Moneo's name-calling, however.
Even the militant modernist, Nikolaus Pevsner (1902--1983)
rejected a theoretical cut-off date for
the concept of building types, which articulated,
to him, the interface between two historical subjects:
"style being a matter of architectural history, [and]
function of social history." [@pevsner:1989history, p. 6]
Giulio Carlo Argan (1909--1992) provided a solid,
if not pioneering, foundation for
contemporary typological research
by defining typology as a time-agnostic
"criterion for classification." [@argan:1961tipologia]
Argan's descriptive concept of typology
gained operative status thanks to
the culturalist theory of Aldo Rossi (1931--1997)
and even more so with the design method of
procedural typology formulated by
Saverio Muratori (1910--1973).
Adding to the diverse definitions and uses of typology,
Carroll William Westfall more recently construed
a didactic model of primal building types
understood as the architectural expression of
invariable political ends---that is,
purposes of the *polis*.


Typology *versus* historiography
================================

For all that has been said about the modernist
rejection of history, the Bauhaus
did comparatively little to push practitioners
and historians apart from each other.
Rather, this rift opened as the methodologies
of historiographical narrative and
historically-informed design were being tailored
to achieve opposite goals.

The difference between Rossi's and Muratori's concepts
of typology is illustrative of the ever-widening rift
between architectural historians and
practitioners---even though both architects moved
from design to historiography and back
throughout their careers.
The emergence of architectural history is attested
in the groundbreaking work and exemplary careers
of three scholars who were also practicing architects,
who set the initial standards for two quite
distinct approaches to the discipline:
first, as a chair within the École des Beaux-Arts
under Viollet-le-Duc (1815--1879),
then as a specialized branch of art history
in the work of the German writers,
Heinrich von Geymüller (1839--1909) and
Cornelius Gurlitt (1850--1938).

Viollet-le-Duc's teaching gave greater rigor to
the conventional use of historical sources
as a basis for design, whereas
the German approach was chiefly concerned with
evidencing a systematic history of styles
in the idealist tradition.
The popularity of Heinrich Wölfflin's (1864--1945)
schematic narratives and Pevsner's influential books
are part of the eventual success of
the German branch of purely academic
architectural history.

Beyond plan and politics
