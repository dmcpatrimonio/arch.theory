Urban context and building types in Beirã
=========================================

Beirã is a *freguesia* (parish district)
under the town council of Marvão
in the Alto Alentejo region of Portugal,
adjoining the *raia* (border with Spain).
As a rural settlement, it dates back
to the early inhabiting of the Iberian peninsula.
The urban area, however, develops from the 1880s
as a result of the opening of a rail link to Spain
in 1878.

As a railway town,
the initial urban and architectural growth of Beirã
is rapid and homogeneous.
A minimal system of street axes and cross-axes
(*ruas* and *travessas*)
articulates a regular parcel pattern (Figure 3).

A few *habitações de frente estreita* are to be found
near the railway crossing (Figure 4).
The urban fabric
is populated mostly by one-story
*habitações de frente larga*, (Figure 5)
and, occasionally, by *moradas de casas altas*
and duplex *sobrados* (Figure 6).
These houses are typically built of local stone,
with brick-framed openings and simple
two-eave roofs draining over the street.

A second growth stage seems to accompany
the enlargement of the passenger station after 1926.
It consists of concrete-frame buildings (Figure 7)
with the frequent use of *alpendres* (front porches),
side entrances, hipped roofs, verandas,
and outbuildings (Figure 8).
This second stage is, however, still in a great deal
tied to regional building types,
introducing variations and adjustments
to the *habitação de frente larga* and *sobrado* types.

Regional typology breaks down in the town extension
towards the highway, in the south, as well as
in some infill built near the railway and on the hill
after the 1950s.
