The critical role of place and history is restored to architectural
design by the Italian morphologists of the postwar period, most notably
Saverio Muratori (1910--1973), a practitioner and professor at the
University of Rome. He develops the method of *procedural typology* to
provide a contextual tool for rebuilding and infilling in historic
Italian sites. Procedural typology is heavily influenced by urban
morphology. It departs from the Conzenian method in considering
three-dimensional architectural form as developed simultaneously with
the parcel patterns that enable it, as well as in positing the
generation of building types by means of successive transformations.
Type is defined in procedural typology as "the historical specification
(spatial and temporal) of typological process, from elementary frames up
to complex derivations."[^1]

The main feature of procedural typology, as outlined by Muratori's
student, Gianfranco Caniggia (1933--1987), is the division of the built
fabric of a site into *base building* and *specialized building*.[^2]
Base building is what concerns us here. It is understood as the minimal
core of what represents, in a given architectural culture---chiefly
vernacular---, the "concept of a house."[^3]

The base type is thus dependent on all geographic and social
determinants of that given culture, meaning it also changes through
time. From the base type, derived building types are obtained by
"diachronic mutations" consisting, mostly, of duplications over the
horizontal and vertical axes (Figure 1). As such, procedural typology is
style-agnostic, that is, slanted towards modernist abstraction. The
method is nonetheless sufficiently robust that it can support a layer
describing the generative typology of individual construction elements,
details, and ornamental schemes.

One important remark about the base building is that, unlike specialized
building, it is mostly detached from specific uses or functions. Though
the base type is generally called, and understood to be, a "house," this
definition is by no means restricted to single-family dwelling. The base
building can range from rural to urban, comprising single- and
multi-family dwellings or more complex group arrangements. In its
earliest forms it will support use as warehouses and workshops for rural
farmsteads, and in its mature expressions it can just as easily contain
retail, offices, and small industrial shops.
