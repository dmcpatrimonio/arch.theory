Typology is generally understood to be the processes or operations by
which a "concept of a house"---or of any sort of more or less
specialized building---is generated, transformed, and eventually
studied. [@caniggia:1997metodologia, p. 15] What is to be done with this
study is, on the other hand, far less generally agreed upon. The Spanish
architect, Rafael Moneo famously argued for "the 'impossibility' of
continuity, and thus of the retrieval of type in its most traditional
and characteristic sense. . . ." [@moneo:1978typology, p. 38] Moneo
expressed a modernist worldview that assumes an insurmountable break
between past and present and an irrevocable loss of innocence, of sorts,
that comes with the intellectual articulation of concepts:

> Did not the historical awareness of the *fact* of type in
> architectural theory forever bar the unity of its practice? Or, to put
> it in another way, is not the theoretical recognition of a fact the
> symptom of its loss? [@moneo:1978typology, p. 40]

The rationale for this argument hinged on the ambiguous role of J.-N. L.
Durand's design method codified in the *Recueil et parallèle* and
*Précis des leçons données à l'École polytechnique*. The latter's core
teaching, in particular, titled "De la marche que l'on doit suivre dans
la composition d'un projet quelconque," [@durand:1805precis2, p. 96]
poisoned Moneo's---and other modernists'---understanding of explicit
typological operations. These operations are then considered formalist
exercises devoid of functional or social meaning. They are, therefore,
to be dismissed as mere "reproduction," in Durand's method, or worse,
morally condemned as "nostalgia," [@moneo:1978typology, p. 38] the
mortal sin of postmodernity.

More serious students of typology have not been deterred by Moneo's
name-calling, however. Even the militant modernist, Nikolaus Pevsner
(1902--1983) rejected a theoretical cut-off date for the concept of
building types, which articulated, to him, the interface between two
historical subjects: "style being a matter of architectural history,
[and] function of social history." [@pevsner:1989history, p. 6]

Giulio Carlo Argan (1909--1992) provided a solid, if not pioneering,
foundation for contemporary typological research by defining typology as
a time agnostic "criterion for classification." [@argan:1966tipologia14]
Argan's descriptive concept of typology gained operative status thanks
to the culturalist theory of Aldo Rossi (1931--1997) and even more so
with the design method of procedural typology formulated by Saverio
Muratori (1910--1973). Adding to the diverse definitions and uses of
typology, Carroll William Westfall more recently construed a didactic
model of primal building types understood as the architectural
expression of invariable political ends---that is, purposes of the
*polis*.
