Typology is generally understood to be the processes or operations by
which a "concept of a house"---or of any sort of more or less
specialized building---is generated, transformed, and eventually
studied.[^1] What is to be done with this study is, on the other hand,
far less generally agreed upon. The Spanish architect, Rafael Moneo
famously argued for "the 'impossibility' of continuity, and thus of the
retrieval of type in its most traditional and characteristic
sense. . . ."[^2] Moneo expressed a modernist worldview that assumes an
insurmountable break between past and present and an irrevocable loss of
innocence, of sorts, that comes with the intellectual articulation of
concepts:

> Did not the historical awareness of the *fact* of type in
> architectural theory forever bar the unity of its practice? Or, to put
> it in another way, is not the theoretical recognition of a fact the
> symptom of its loss?[^3]

The rationale for this argument hinged on the ambiguous role of J.-N. L.
Durand's design method codified in the *Recueil et parallèle* and
*Précis des leçons données à l'École polytechnique*. The latter's core
teaching, in particular, titled "De la marche que l'on doit suivre dans
la composition d'un projet quelconque,"[^4] poisoned Moneo's---and other
modernists'---understanding of explicit typological operations. These
operations are then considered formalist exercises devoid of functional
or social meaning. They are, therefore, to be dismissed as mere
"reproduction," in Durand's method, or worse, morally condemned as
"nostalgia,"[^5] the mortal sin of postmodernity.

More serious students of typology have not been deterred by Moneo's
name-calling, however. Even the militant modernist, Nikolaus Pevsner
(1902--1983) rejected a theoretical cut-off date for the concept of
building types, which articulated, to him, the interface between two
historical subjects: "style being a matter of architectural history,
\[and\] function of social history."[^6]

Giulio Carlo Argan (1909--1992) provided a solid, if not pioneering,
foundation for contemporary typological research by defining typology as
a time agnostic "criterion for classification."[^7] Argan's descriptive
concept of typology gained operative status thanks to the culturalist
theory of Aldo Rossi (1931--1997) and even more so with the design
method of procedural typology formulated by Saverio Muratori
(1910--1973). Adding to the diverse definitions and uses of typology,
Carroll William Westfall more recently construed a didactic model of
primal building types understood as the architectural expression of
invariable political ends---that is, purposes of the *polis*.
